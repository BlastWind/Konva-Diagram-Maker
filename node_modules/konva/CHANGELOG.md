## Breaking

Customs builds are temporary removed from npm package. You can not use `import Konva from 'konva/src/Core';`.
This feature will be added back later.

### Possibly breaking

That changes are private and internal specific. They should not break most of `Konva` apps.

* `Konva.Util.addMethods` is removed
* `Konva.Util._removeLastLetter`  is removed
* `Konva.Util._getImage`  is removed
* `Konv.Util._getRGBAString`  is removed
* `Konv.Util._merge`  is removed
* Removed polyfill for `requestAnimationFrame`.
* `id` and `name` properties defaults are empty strings, not `undefined`
* internal `_cache` property was updated to use es2015 `Map` instead of `{}`.
* `Konva.Validators` is removed.


### Added
* Show a warning when a stage has too many layers
* Show a warning on duplicate ids
* Show a warning on weird class in `Node.create` parsing from JSON
* Show a warning for incorrect value for component setters.
* Show a warning for incorrect value for `zIndex` property.
* Show a warning when user is trying to reuse destroyed shape.
* new publish method `measureSize(string)` for `Konva.Text`
* You can configure what mouse buttons can be used for drag&drop. To enable right button you can use `Konva.dragButtons = [0, 1]`.
* Now you can hide stage `stage.visible(false)`. It will set its container display style to "none".
* New method `stage.setPointersPositions(event)`. Usually you don't need to use it manually.
* New method `layer.toggleHitCanvas()` to show and debug hit areas

### Changed
* Full rewrite to Typescript with tons of refactoring and small optimizations. The public API should be 100% the same
* Fixed `patternImage` and `radialGradient` for `Konva.Text`
* `Konva.Util._isObject` is renamed to `Konva.Util._isPlainObject`.
* A bit changed behavior of `removeId` (private method), now it doesn't clear node ref, if object is changed.
* simplified `batchDraw` method (it doesn't use `Konva.Animation`) now.
* Performance improvements for shapes will image patterns, linear and radial fills
* `text.getTextHeight()` is deprecated. Use `text.height()` or `text.fontSize()` instead.
* Private method `stage._setPointerPosition()` is deprecated. Use `stage.setPointersPositions(event)`;

### Fixed
